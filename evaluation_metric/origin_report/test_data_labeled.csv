Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Heart size and mediastinal structures are unchanged. The previously described remaining pleural densities along the upper right lateral chest wall in the shoulder area show diminished thickness of the pleural density surrounding the operative area. Postoperative localized apical pneumothorax has diminished further and is now barely 1 cm wide, also showing increasing pleural scar formation. No new abnormalities are seen. The left hemithorax is unchanged, though no evidence of new pulmonary abnormalities.","PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired. There is volume loss on the right with associated elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, consistent with the provided history of prior right upper lobectomy. Pleural densities along the right upper lateral chest wall are not significantly changed. Similarly, opacity at the right apex along the superior mediastinum is not significantly changed, possibly loculated fluid in the pleural space. There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. There is no left pleural effusion. No definite pneumothorax is seen. There is evidence of prior right thoracotomy, involving the right posterior sixth rib. Cervical fusion hardware is incompletely assessed.","Pain, redness, and slight swelling at right chest surgical site for the past two days. Patient has undergone a prior right VATS, converted to a thoracotomy with right upper lobectomy for a pulmonary nodule which was thought to be malignant but pathology revealed only a granulomatous inflammatory process.
